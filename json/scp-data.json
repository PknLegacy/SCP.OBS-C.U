  "text": "SCP Data Archive\n\nPurpose:\nThe SCP Data Archive represents the culmination of decades of systematic observation, acquisition, and codification. It is a labyrinth of interlinked recordsâ€”each one a piece of a puzzle that humanity may never fully solve.\n\nStructure:\nFiles are fragmented, cross-linked, and intentionally mislabeled in order to deter infiltration attempts. Only through hierarchical clearance protocols can the true structure be revealed. Data is never stored linearly, ensuring unauthorized access yields only noise and contradictions.\n\nPsychological Impact:\nThose who enter the Archive must be prepared for cognitive dissonance, existential dread, and destabilization of prior worldviews. To confront the Archive is to confront the vastness of the anomalous."
