  "text": "Incident Reports\n\nOperational Memory:\nIncident Reports constitute the operational memory of Foundation512, chronicling every breach, failure, and catastrophic miscalculation with brutal honesty. These documents are not censored for moraleâ€”they are retained as grim evidence of the stakes involved in containment.\n\nStructure:\nEach Incident Report follows a rigid structure: Pre-Event Conditions, Trigger, Escalation Sequence, Containment Response, and Aftermath. This systematic layout ensures future operatives can rapidly assess patterns and apply countermeasures.\n\nPurpose:\nThe reports, while grim, are essential pedagogical tools. They serve as monuments to the cost of ignorance, complacency, and error. No recruit may advance in clearance without first internalizing the consequences described in these pages."
